In this assignment my goal was to create a single page application using a JavaScript library called React. The idea I decided upon for the app was a simple online storefront for selling video games. I wanted users to be able to simulate purchasing games and adding them to their library. I also wanted to be able to sort the games in the store/user’s library either alphabetically or by release date. I had originally planned to implement a sign-up/login feature and a search functionality but unfortunately ran out of time before I was able to get around to it. I did get 4 routes working (3 normal and a 404 page), sorting, and users are able to “purchase” games to add to their library which they can view and sort at their leisure. I also made the title of each game a link to the actual website for the game. I created a navigation bar to make it easy for the user to switch between views easily and quickly. I styled the website with CSS to make it elegant and user-friendly.
